# Project Euler solutions

The source code for programs used to solve the first 100 Project Euler problems
is found in this repo. Project Euler wishes that its participants do not share
the solutions to problem numbers > 100. I have instead signed the answer to the
problems > 100 that I have solved. If you also have the answer, you can
verify my answer with [this GPG key][1]:

```shell
$ gpg --import johndriscoll.asc
$ python3 euler-0101.py | gpg --verify euler-0101.asc -
```
